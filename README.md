# Shining-Drive-23
Rework of the Shining Drive Portfolio Site during the spring '23 semester

Choosing to pursue the independant project course, I would like to use the opportunity to participate in a
capstone project catered to my experience in the Web Design AAS and how it has aided me in an attempt
to pursue game development. In order to do so, I am proposing a two-part project: revisiting my work
from ART 263 and 117 to complete and upload a fully functional portfolio website that performs the
behaviors in my prototype and working through a proposal, prototype and iteration on a game demo via
the skillset I’ve been working on from ART 217 and ITP 140 along with community tutorials and
documentation from the Unity Engine community that would also be hosted on the site.

The purpose behind the site was to create a personal document that utilize design choices
that allow for quick navigation, including page interactivity to quickly switch between projects that I’ve
worked on that display my credibility in being able to perform certain tasks within game development
like concept art, character animation, and coding. Wanting to pursue a career in this direction required
careful planning within the degree program that resulted in taking classes that I have been able to
create and archive work that will be used in a portfolio and am in the unique position of being able to
combine all of it together into a complete website that will speak towards the credibility I am
attempting to establish.

And to elaborate on that credibility, while I have not had the opportunity to participate in a class within
game development – I could still use this project to dive into the resources and documentation on the Unity game
engine software provided by its community and establish another work that will speak to the credibility I
am constantly striving to improve upon.
