                <h2>Storyteller in Training</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s something powerful about being able to tell stories, even as a kid there was something about being able to wield this skill that enticed me to try and learn it. Listening to people recount times when their resolve were being tested and rewarded through their trials lights a fire inside of me, hyping me up to be aware of similar situations that await me in my own future.
                    <br><br> 
                    In deciding to return to higher education, I’ve also decided to resume practicing this skill: In the hopes that one day I might be able to do for others what my inspirations have done for me. And to that end these next stories go over the events of how I made the decision to return during the year of 2020. 
                </p>

            <div id="bio_story">
                <h3>Prologue</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting with my studies as an engineering technician in 2015, I would spend the time in between classes developing illustration skills – being smitten with the chance to one day work with storytelling as a concept artist, I would use all the time I could find to practice. 
                    <br><br>
                    The degree was supposed to get me a job in a rookie position and make life become easier in terms of having the freedom to pursue what I really wanted with the financial support to make it happen. I graduated at the top of my class and couldn’t get anything.
                    <br><br>
                    This wasn’t in the plan and I had to come up with something to do to support myself, so I made the decision to transfer into studying to become an engineer as my illustrations weren’t anywhere near ready to go professional with. And in deciding to pursue something more realistic I made the difficult choice to put way all the progress I had made up to that point in illustration.
