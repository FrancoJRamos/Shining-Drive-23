    "Starting with my studies as an engineering technician in 2015, I would spend the time in between classes developing illustration skills – being smitten with the chance to one day work with storytelling as a concept artist, I would use all the time I could find to practice.<br><br> The degree was supposed to get me a job in a rookie position and make life become easier in terms of having the freedom to pursue what I really wanted with the financial support to make it happen. I graduated at the top of my class and still couldn’t lock down a job in the field.<br><br> This wasn’t in the plan and I had to come up with something to do to support myself, so I made the decision to transfer into studying to become an engineer as my illustrations weren’t anywhere near ready to go professional with. And in deciding to pursue something more realistic I made the difficult choice to put way all the progress I had made up to that point in illustration.",
    "Transitioning into studying engineering was possible because of a strong foundation in my math skills, and as long as those skills where able to open the door to new possibilities, I was going to keep on developing those skills.<br><br> And in sticking to the decision of giving up illustration to focus on mechanical engineering let me start from certification in Autodesk Inventor for parametric modeling where I could copy any design specifications to create an accurate 3D model as a technician , to understanding the why’s and how’s of what goes into making those same design specifications by starting from the problem and mapping out every decision with evidence as to why those decisions are made through calculations and planning.<br><br> And at the beginning of 2020 I was getting to the end of this transition from technician to engineer. But I still couldn’t shake the feelings of deciding to give up on illustration. And as opportunities began appearing for these skills, a hesitation followed. Wondering if each decision was correct, every opportunity was met with the whiplash of dreaming about what might have been if I had been confident enough to stand by illustrative work. And while wishing I had more time to decide, the pandemic hit.",
